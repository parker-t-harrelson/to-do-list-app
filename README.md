Welcome to my To Do List Web Application

The purpose of this app is to allow a user to create reminders and notes for themself such that they can manage their activities and goals in a more organized way. The user can create folders for specific categories of tasks. Within each folder, the user can create as many to do actions as they please.

The to do activies should have the ability to be added, updated and changed, completed, and deleted. Possibly a feature will be added in which the user can add an end date for the specific activity. If the task isn't completed by said time, it will prompt the user with a warning

The web app will allow a user to have their own account such that they can store their tasks and folders and come back to them whenever they please. An account is not required to use the application, but the to do notes will be lost when the user leaves the webpage or deletes their cookies.
